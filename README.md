# MetaQ

*MetaQ for VirindiTank and Asheron's Call - Reach out to Jiggiwatt on Discord for questions, support, or feedback.*

**Download the MetaQv4.0.1.zip file and see README.PDF for more info**

## Roadmap
1. Make the 'Edit Queue' functionality more intuitive, including better messaging (e.g. confirm clearing queue)
2. Allow for more functionality to be used via the Chaos Helper UI when MetaQ is not running (i.e. when one of the queued metas is in progress)
3. Deprecate chat commands - The design concessions required to accomodate chat commands limits functionality too much. This will make Chaos Helper a firm requirement to use MetaQ
4. Update Lugian Assault so that characters check for doors to be open prior to running across the rock rooms. Currently this is triggered as part of the leader's nav route by sending a fellowship message after pulling the lever, which is not always reliable.

## Feature Requests
1. Add a watchdog to the Nexus which portal recalls to the beginning of the dungeon if a character gets stuck prior to the lever room.
2. Change the 'rally' state that's used by various metas to move on without rallied characters after a reasonable period of time.
